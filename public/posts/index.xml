      <description>Hugo + Org Hello everyone this is Org mode + hugo. Org files work out-of-the-box with hugo. But there are some issues with images and other features. To resolve this issues you will need a mode called ox-hugo. Then you can easily export org files as hugo&amp;rsquo;s markdown format and it works great. Setup is easy and even you can post sub-tree which is great if you want to keep everything in one big file.</description>
