### First Post {#first-post}

Hello everyone this is Org mode + hugo. Org files work out-of-the-box
with hugo. But there are some issues with images and other features.
To resolve this issues you will need a mode called _ox-hugo_. Then you
can easily export org files as hugo's markdown format and it works great.
Setup is easy and even you can post sub-tree which is great if you want to
keep everything in one big file.
